# Workaround when multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked to
# the program, which happens when PyTorch loads OpenMP runtime first. Not that
# this method is "unsafe, unsupported, undocumented", but we found it to be
# generally safe to use. This should be deprecated once we found a way to
# "ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process".

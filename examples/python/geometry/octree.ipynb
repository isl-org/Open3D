    "# Octree\n",
    "An **octree** is a tree data structure where each internal node has eight children. Octrees are commonly used for spatial partitioning of 3D point clouds. Non-empty leaf nodes of an octree contain one or more points that fall within the same spatial subdivision. Octrees are a useful description of 3D space and can be used to quickly find nearby points. Open3D has the geometry type `Octree` that can be used to create, search, and traverse octrees with a user-specified maximum tree depth, `max_depth`."

Each point is inserted into the tree by following the path from the root node to the appropriate leaf node at depth `max_depth`. As the tree depth increases, internal (and eventually leaf) nodes represents a smaller partition of 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the point cloud has color, the the corresponding leaf node takes the color of the last inserted point. The `size_expand` parameter increases the size of the root octree node so it is slightly bigger than the original point cloud bounds to accomodate all points."

# Currently this meta file is created manaully. We can also generate this meta
# file with `conda skeleton pypi open3d-python`. The main difference is that
# the this manaully create meta.yaml uses the shared objects in the local
# `pip_package` folder, while the auto generated meta uses the PyPI source
# distribution during Conda package creation. The manual meta file is chosen
# since we'll use the `open3d` name rather than open3d-python`.

### Recent snapshots

Snapshots may contain new features, bug-fixes or new OpenGL extensions ahead of tested, official releases.

## Build

It is highly recommended to build from a tgz or zip release snapshot.
The code generation workflow is a complex brew of gnu make, perl and python, that works best on Linux or Mac.
For most end-users of GLEW the official releases are the best choice, with first class support.

### Linux and Mac

#### Using GNU Make

##### Install build tools

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:    `$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev libosmesa-dev`

RedHat/CentOS/Fedora:  `$ sudo yum install libXmu-devel libXi-devel libGL-devel`

##### Build

	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ make clean

Targets:    `all, glew.lib (sub-targets: glew.lib.shared, glew.lib.static), glew.bin, clean, install, uninstall`

Variables:  `SYSTEM=linux-clang, GLEW_DEST=/usr/local, STRIP=`

_Note: may need to make **auto** folder_

#### Using cmake

*CMake 2.8.12 or higher is required.*

##### Install build tools

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:   `$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libXmu-dev libXi-dev libgl-dev cmake`

RedHat/CentOS/Fedora: `$ sudo yum install libXmu-devel libXi-devel libGL-devel cmake`

##### Build

	$ cd build
	$ cmake ./cmake 
	$ make -j4

| Target     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| glew       | Build the glew shared library. |
| glew_s     | Build the glew static library. |
| glewinfo   | Build the `glewinfo` executable (requires `BUILD_UTILS` to be `ON`). |
| visualinfo | Build the `visualinfo` executable (requires `BUILD_UTILS` to be `ON`). |
| install    | Install all enabled targets into `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. |
| clean      | Clean up build artifacts. |
| all        | Build all enabled targets (default target). |

| Variables       | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| BUILD_UTILS     | Build the `glewinfo` and `visualinfo` executables. |
| GLEW_REGAL      | Build in Regal mode. |
| GLEW_OSMESA     | Build in off-screen Mesa mode. |
| BUILD_FRAMEWORK | Build as MacOSX Framework.  Setting `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `/Library/Frameworks` is recommended. |

## glewinfo

`glewinfo` is a command-line tool useful for inspecting the capabilities of an
OpenGL implementation and GLEW support for that.  Please include `glewinfo.txt`
with bug reports, as appropriate.	

	---------------------------
	    GLEW Extension Info
	---------------------------

	GLEW version 2.0.0
	Reporting capabilities of pixelformat 3
	Running on a Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 from Intel
	OpenGL version 3.1.0 - Build 9.17.10.4229 is supported

## Code Generation

A Unix or Mac environment is needed for building GLEW from scratch to
include new extensions, or customize the code generation. The extension
data is regenerated from the top level source directory with:

	make extensions

An alternative to generating the GLEW sources from scratch is to
download a pre-generated (unsupported) snapshot:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/snapshots/

Travis-built snapshots are also available:

https://glew.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

## Authors

GLEW is currently maintained by [Nigel Stewart](https://github.com/nigels-com)
with bug fixes, new OpenGL extension support and new releases.

GLEW was developed by [Milan Ikits](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ikits/)
and [Marcelo Magallon](http://wwwvis.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~magallon/).
Aaron Lefohn, Joe Kniss, and Chris Wyman were the first users and also
assisted with the design and debugging process.  

The acronym GLEW originates from Aaron Lefohn.
Pasi K&auml;rkk&auml;inen identified and fixed several problems with
GLX and SDL.  Nate Robins created the `wglinfo` utility, to
which modifications were made by Michael Wimmer.

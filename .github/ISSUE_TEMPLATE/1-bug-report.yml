      I have been trying to run the colored point cloud registration for 2
      point clouds of raw sizes of approximately 7 million points by following
      the colored point cloud registration. However, every time I run the code,
      it results in a segmentation fault.

      I tried downsampling the two by varying voxel sizes ranging from
      0.01 to 0.1 for increasing speed. However, this does not rectify the situation.

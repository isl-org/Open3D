# Running workflows on GitHub Actions

## OS versions

Use the oldest available OS version (e.g. ubuntu-18.04, macos-11, windows-2019)
for each workflow to ensure created binary artifacts are as widely compatible as
possible. For jobs that use docker, or auxiliary jobs (e.g. uploading artifacts
to google cloud), use ubuntu-latest to avoid changing the version on GitHub
actions updates. On macOS and Windows, using Ubuntu reduces CI cost.

## Documentation deployment

### Directory structure

-   `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`: Github Actions workflow file to
    create and deploy documentation. Documentation is created for every branch
    as a CI test, but deployed only for `main`.
-   `util/ci_utils.sh:build_docs()`: Called by GitHub Actions to build documentation.
-   `unpack_docs.sh`: Called by the documentation server to deploy the docs into
    the website.

### Setting up the docs deployment

#### Step 1: Google Cloud

1.  Setup `gcloud`
    -   [Install `gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)
    -   `gcloud init` and login with admin's google account on the web
2.  Create storage bucket

    ```bash
    # Create with uniform bucket-level access: `-b`
    # https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-gsutil
    # gsutil mb -p [PROJECT_ID] -c [STORAGE_CLASS] -l [BUCKET_LOCATION] -b on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
    gsutil mb -p isl-buckets -c STANDARD -l US -b on gs://open3d-docs/

    # Grant public read permission
    # The current user must have appropriate permission, you may do this in the web interface
    gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://open3d-docs/

    # Set object life cycle
    # https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managing-lifecycles#delete_an_object
    gsutil lifecycle set gcs.lifecycle.json gs://open3d-docs/
    ```

    Objects will be stored in the bucket for 30 days. Currently, the
    documentation server fetches the latest docs from `main` branch every hour.
    If the documentation server fails to fetch the docs matching the `main`
    commit id, the last successfully fetched docs will be displayed.
3.  Create service account
    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts create open3d-ci-sa \
        --description="Service account for Open3D CI" \
        --display-name="open3d-ci-sa"
    ```
4.  Grant `objectAdmin` to the service account
    ```bash
    gsutil iam ch \
        serviceAccount:open3d-ci-sa@isl-buckets.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin \
        gs://open3d-docs
    ```
5.  Create key for service account
    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/open3d-ci-sa-key.json \
    --iam-account open3d-ci-sa@isl-buckets.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

Now `~/open3d-ci-sa-key.json` should have been created.

#### Step 2: GitHub

1.  Encode the private key json file with `base64 ~/open3d-ci-sa-key.json` and
    add the output text to the
    [GitHub repository secrets](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/settings/secrets)
    with name `GCE_SA_KEY_DOCS_CI`

2.  Also add secret `GCE_DOCS_PROJECT: isl-buckets`

## Google compute engine setup for GPU CI

### CI Procedure

The GCE CI workflow `.github/workflows/gce-ubuntu-docker.yml` performs these steps:

-   Clone the repository
-   Build docker image, starting with a an NVIDIA base devel image with CUDA and
    cuDNN.
-   Push image to Google container registry.
-   On Google Compute Engine (GCE), in parallel (up to GPU quota limit - currently
    4):
-   Create a new VM instance with a custom OS image
-   Run docker image on GCE (Google Compute Engine) with environment variables
    set for specific build config.
-   The docker image entrypoint is the `run-ci.sh` script: build, install, run
    tests and uninstall.
-   Delete the VM instance.

A separate VM instance is created for each commit and build option. The VM
instances are named according to the commit hash and build config ID used. We
cycle through 13 different US GCE zones if VM creation fails in the first zone,
either due to lack of resources or GPU quota exhaustion.

### Setup

#### Step 1: Google Cloud: Create service account and key

1.  Create service account
    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts create open3d-ci-sa \
        --description="Service account for Open3D CI" \
        --display-name="open3d-ci-sa"    \
        --project open3d-dev
    ```
2.  Grant `Compute Instance Admin (beta)` to the service account
    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding open3d-dev \
        --member=serviceAccount:open3d-ci-sa-gpu@open3d-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --role=roles/compute.instanceAdmin \
        --project open3d-dev
    ```
3.  Create key for service account
    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/open3d-ci-sa-key.json \
        --iam-account open3d-ci-sa@open3d-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --project open3d-dev
    ```
    Now `~/open3d-ci-sa-key.json` should have been created.

#### Step 2: Google Cloud: Create custom VM image

```bash
./util/docker/open3d-gpu/scripts/gce-ubuntu-docker-run.sh create-base-vm-image
```

The custom VM image has NVIDIA drivers, `nvidia-container-toolkit` and `docker`
installed. It contains today's date in the name and the image family is set to
`ubuntu-os-docker-gpu-2204-lts`. The latest image from this family is
used for running CI.

#### Step 3: GitHub

1.  Encode the private key json file with `base64 ~/open3d-ci-sa-key.json` and
    add the output text to the
    [GitHub repository secrets](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/settings/secrets)
    with name `GCE_SA_KEY_GPU_CI`
2.  Also add secret `GCE_PROJECT: open3d-dev`

## Ccache strategy

-   Typically, a build generates ~500MB cache. A build with Filament compiled from
    source generates ~600MB cache.
-   Typically, regular X86 Ubuntu and macOS builds take about 40 mins without
    caching.
-   The bottleneck of the CI is in the ARM build since it runs on a simulator.
    When building Filament from source, the build time can exceed GitHub's 6-hour
    limit if caching is not properly activated. With proper caching and good cache
    hit rate, the ARM build job can run within 1 hour.
-   Both Ubuntu and macOS have a max cache setting of 2GB each out of a total
    cache limit of 10GB for the whole repository. Windows MSVC does not use
    caching at present since `cmake + ccache` requires Ninja instead of MSBuild.
    Most users use MSVC / MSBuild instead of Ninja and this would make resolving
    user issues harder.
-   ARM64 cache (limit 1.5GB) is stored on Google cloud bucket
    (`open3d-ci-cache` in the `isl-buckets` project). The bucket is world
    readable, but needs the `open3d-ci-sa` service account for writing. Every
    ARM64 build downloads the cache contents before build. Only `main` branch
    builds use `gsutil rsync` to update the cache in GCS. Cache transfer only
    takes a few minutes, but reduces ARM64 CI time to about 1:15 hours.

## Development wheels and binary archives for user testing

`main` branch Python wheels and binary archives are uploaded to a world
readable GCS bucket in `open3d-releases/{python-wheels,devel}` for users
to try out development wheels.

### Google Cloud storage

Follow instructions in A. Documentation deployment to setup a Google cloud
bucket with:

-   Project: open3d-dev
-   Service account: open3d-ci-sa-gpu
-   Bucket name: open3d-ci-sa-gpu
-   Public read permissions
-   One month (30 days) object lifecycle

```bash
gsutil mb -p open3d-dev -c STANDARD -l US -b on gs://open3d-releases
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://open3d-releases
gsutil lifecycle set gcs.lifecycle.json gs:/open3d-releases
gsutil iam ch \
    serviceAccount:open3d-ci-sa-gpu@open3d-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin \
    gs://open3d-releases
```

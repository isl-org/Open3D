Python
======

Open3D Python packages are distributed via
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/open3d/>`_ and
`Conda <https://anaconda.org/open3d-admin/open3d>`_.

Supported Python versions:

.. hlist::
    :columns: 4

    * 3.6
    * 3.7
    * 3.8
    * 3.9

Supported operating systems:

* Ubuntu 18.04+
* macOS 10.15+
* Windows 10 (64-bit)

If you have other Python versions or operating systems, please refer to
:ref:`compilation` and compile Open3D from source.

Pip (PyPI)
----------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install open3d

.. note::
   We recommend using ``pip`` version >=20.3 for better platform compatibility
   checking in Linux.

.. note::
    In general, we recommend using a
    `virtual environment <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>`_ for
    containerization. Otherwise, depending on the configurations, ``pip3`` may
    be needed for Python 3, or the ``--user`` option may need to be used to
    avoid permission issues. For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip3 install open3d
        # or
        pip install --user open3d
        # or
        python3 -m pip install --user open3d

Development version (pip)
-------------------------

To test the latest features in Open3D, download and install the development
version (``HEAD`` of ``master`` branch):

Please use these links from the `latest version of this page <http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html>`__ only. For example, to install the latest development version on Linux for Python 3.9:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user --pre https://storage.googleapis.com/open3d-releases-master/python-wheels/open3d-@OPEN3D_VERSION_FULL@-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl

.. note::
   The development wheels for Linux are named according to PEP600. Please
   use ``pip`` version >=20.3 to install them. The wheels are not yet fully
   PEP600 compliant.

Conda
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c open3d-admin -c conda-forge open3d

.. note::

    Open3D prebuilt binaries for Conda (Anaconda/Miniconda) can be found at
    `open3d <https://anaconda.org/open3d-admin/open3d>`_. Currently, the
    ``open3d`` package is distributed under the ``open3d-admin`` channel. To
    setup Conda, please see
    `the official documentation <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_.


Docker
------

If you want to install the Open3D Python packages in a docker container you will
need to install a minimum set of dependencies. For more details please see `this issue <https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues/3388>`__.

A minimal ``Dockerfile`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: dockerfile

    # This could also be another ubuntu or debian based distributions
    FROM ubuntu:20.04

    # Install Open3D system dependencies and pip
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
        libgl1 \
        libgomp1 \
        python3-pip \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    # Install Open3D from the pypi repositories
    RUN python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade open3d

.. note:: If you need ``CUDA`` support, follow these `directions.
    <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu>`__

Try it
------

Now, try importing Open3D.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import open3d as o3d"

If this works, congratulations, now Open3D has been successfully installed!


Troubleshooting:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you get an error when importing Open3D, enable detailed Python warnings to
help troubleshoot the issue:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -W default -c "import open3d as o3d"


Running Open3D tutorials
------------------------

A complete set of Python tutorials and testing data will also be copied to
demonstrate the usage of Open3D Python interface. See ``examples/python`` for
all Python examples.

.. note:: Open3D's Python tutorial utilizes some external packages: ``numpy``,
    ``matplotlib``, ``opencv-python``. OpenCV is only used for reconstruction
    system. Please read util/install-deps-python.sh for installing these
    packages.


.. _install_open3d_c++:

C++
===

To get started with using Open3D in your C++ applications, you can download a
binary package archive from `Github releases
<https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/releases>`__ (since `v0.15`). These binary
package archives contain the Open3D shared library built with all supported
features and are available for the main supported platforms. Also, the latest
development version (``HEAD`` of ``master`` branch) binary package archives are
provided here:

:Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ or glibc 2.27+ [#]_):
    .. hlist::
        :columns: 2

.. [#] To check the `glibc` version on your system, run :code:`ldd --version`

If you need only a subset of features, or a custom build configuration, please
refer to :ref:`compilation` and compile Open3D from source.

Try it
------

Extract the archive and move the contents to a local folder (such as
``~/Documents/Open3D_install``):

.. code-block:: bash

    Open3D_install
    ├── include
    │   └── open3d
    │       ├── core
    │       ├── ...
    │       ├── Open3DConfig.h
    │       ├── Open3D.h
    │       ├── ...
    └── lib
        ├── cmake
        │   └── Open3D
        ├── libOpen3D.so
        ├── open3d_tf_ops.so
        └── open3d_torch_ops.so


In Windows, you will have an additional ``bin`` folder with ``Open3D.dll``. Some
files may be absent in the case of unsupported functionality. To use Open3D with
your programs through `cmake`, add ``-D Open3D_ROOT=~/Documents/Open3D_install``
to your CMake configure command line. See the following example CMake projects for
reference:

* `Find Pre-Installed Open3D Package in CMake <https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-find-package>`__
* `Use Open3D as a CMake External Project <https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-external-project>`__

.. warning:: In Linux, do not link code with different CXX11 ABIs, since this will
    most likely cause linker errors or crashes. Most system libraries in recent Linux
    versions (e.g. if the OS came with GCC versions 5+) use the CXX11 ABI, while PyTorch
    and Tensorflow libraries typically use the pre CXX11 ABI. You can build Open3D
    from source with your chosen ABI by setting ``GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI`` in CMake.

The C++ code examples in the ``examples/cpp`` folder of the repository illustrate
a lot of the functionality available in Open3D and are a good place to start
using Open3D in your projects.

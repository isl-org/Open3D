    "This tutorial demonstrates the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) registration algorithm. It has been a mainstay of geometric registration in both research and industry for many years. The inputs are two point clouds and an initial transformation that roughly aligns the source point cloud to the target point cloud. The output is a refined transformation that tightly aligns the two point clouds. A helper function `draw_registration_result` visualizes the alignment during the registration process. In this tutorial, we show different ICP variants, and the API for using them."

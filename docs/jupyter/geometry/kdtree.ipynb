    "Besides the KNN search `search_knn_vector_3d` and the RNN search `search_radius_vector_3d`, Open3D provides a hybrid search function `search_hybrid_vector_3d`. It returns at most k nearest neighbors that have distances to the anchor point less than a given radius. This function combines the criteria of KNN search and RNN search. It is known as RKNN search in some literatures. It has performance benefits in many practical cases, and is heavily used in a number of Open3D functions.\n",
